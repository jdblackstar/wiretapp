# Wiretapp Collector Configuration
COLLECTOR_PORT=8000

# SDK Configuration: Where the SDK should send events
# If running collector in Docker (exposed on port 8000) and SDK on host:
WIRETAPP_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:8000/events"
# If SDK is also a container in the same Docker network as 'collector':
# WIRETAPP_ENDPOINT="http://collector:8000/events"

# Set to "1" to include full prompt/completion content in telemetry, "0" to exclude
WIRETAPP_INCLUDE_CONTENT="0"

# Kafka Configuration (primarily for the collector service)
# These are typically used by the collector when running with Docker Compose,
# as docker-compose.yml often provides these.
# For local development outside Docker, you might need to set these.
# KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS="localhost:9094" # If accessing Kafka from host machine (see kafka:LISTENER_EXTERNAL in docker-compose)
KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS="kafka:29092" # Default for within Docker network (see collector env in docker-compose)
KAFKA_RAW_EVENTS_TOPIC="wiretapp_events_raw"
KAFKA_VALIDATED_EVENTS_TOPIC="wiretapp_events_validated"

# MinIO Configuration (example values)
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY="minio"
MINIO_SECRET_KEY="minio123"
# MINIO_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:9000" # If Minio is running and accessible here
